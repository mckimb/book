    operational: true
  Smart:
    comment: Upper sensor was fixed and the downward irradiance Fdw has to be corrected. For quicklooks the offset angles have been approximated so Fdw has to be regarded as preliminary.
    operational: true
  SpecMACS:
    comment: Nadir measurements started about 20 min after takeoff due to temperature issues. Some ice on one of the side cameras just before it got dark. Measurements stopped at 20:30 UTC due to darkness.

### EarthCare Underpass

*HALO-20240813a underpass distance 31 m at 2024-08-13T15:39:53.0 s*

## Impressions

(itemized list of things you saw)
* north of the ITCZ edge shallow clouds were overlayed by a heavy dust layer. Cirrus clouds aloft.
* about 138 nm from SAL there was an abrupt drop of about 5mm in the PW
* EC meeting point at 15:41:30 UTC on slightly lower FL360
* passing by the northern circle on the EC track there are very calm surface winds obvious from a narrow sun glint spot in specMACS and high radar reflectivity from the surface at around 15:55 UTC

```{note}
Co-location with ATR and EarthCARE over an aerosol layer near SAL. Spectacular line of convection on southern edge toward the west.
