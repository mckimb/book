## Summary

RV-METEOR is still at the port in Mindelo, still awaiting the arrival of containers with scientific equipment and ship provisions as well as air freight. In the morning, the chief steward provided an orientation to life on the ship and a tour. Otherwise, configuration of instruments and preparations for departure continued.

## Remarks

- The chef provided a wonderful Sunday lunch.

## Outlook

- Load containers when they arrive
- Had hoped to depart Mindelo and meet HALO on 13 August, but this is now unlikely
- Planning for first oceanographic station on 15 August
