## Summary

RV-METEOR is still at the port in Mindelo, still awaiting the arrival of containers with scientific equipment and ship provisions as well as air freight. The delay in the container is due to an issue with a crane in the harbor of Praia.

In the late morning, D. Klocke updated the status of the campaign to the scientific group in a meeting at 10:20. During the meeting, a dynamic was played in which every member of the scientific group introduced someone who did not know before the campaign. Moreover, It was decided to have a daily meeting at 10:20 local time.

Scientific groups continue with the installation and calibration of instruments.

## Remarks
