## Summary

After a busy day and night of loading containers and provisions and setting up instruments, Meteor finally departed Mindelo at 06:20 LT on Friday 16 August. The lidar crew worked for 19 hours straight to get the lidar set up. Preparations are underway for deploying oceanographic instruments upon arrival at the Pirata buoy in the afternoon on 17 August. The SEA-POL radar is experiencing problems with its dual-polarization retrievals. Troubleshooting is in progress and it is running in single-polarization mode for now. 

In terms of the conditions, there were overcast skies upon departure from Mindelo and gently rolling seas. There was some clearing as the day went on, but persistent clouds have prevented calibration of the lidar water vapor channel. Waves and swell increased as the day went on.

## Remarks

- 5 radiosondes were launched.
- All instruments have been turned on.
- SEA-POL is running in single-polarization mode.
- No coordination with HALO on 16.08 or 18.08 is planned.
- Dolphins were sighted off the bow in the evening.

## Plans

- 16.08, 06:20 LT: Departed from Mindelo!
- 17.08, 16:30 LT: Arrival at Pirata buoy at 11.5 N, 23 W. 
- 17.08, 16:30 LT - 18.08, 13:00 LT: Operations near Pirata buoy. Deploy two gliders and a wirewalker ~25 nm south of the buoy, perform slow circles to point SEA-POL radar towards convection.
- 18.08, 13:00 LT - Steam towards 9.5 N, 26.714 W (center of center circle of planned HALO flight for Tuesday 20.08)
- 20.08, 12:00 LT - Arrive at 9.5 N, 26.714 W (center of center circle of planned HALO flight for Tuesday 20.08)
