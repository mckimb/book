## Summary

RV Meteor had a busy night and day of operations. Throughout the night and early morning, a sequence of CTDs, ocean microstructure measurements, and SEA-POL circles were performed south of the Pirata buoy. During a SEA-POL circle, the ship executes a circle of radius 500 m over 20 minutes with a coordinated 5-minute radar scan cycle that fills in the blocked sector over the course of the circle. A zig zag pattern was also executed to achieve the same goal. In the morning, a glider, drifter and wirewalker were successfully deployed before steaming back towards the Pirata buoy and deploying another glider and performing an additional CTD and microstructure measurement. Meteor then began steaming towards 9.5 N, 26.714 W (the center of center circle of the planned HALO flight for Tuesday 20.08).

The daily status briefing and forecast discussion was held at 10:20. Skies were brighter and seas were somewhat calmer during the day.

## Remarks

- Radiosondes were launched on the normal 3-hourly schedule. 
- SEA-POL is running in single-polarization mode.
- Raman lidar is still waiting for clear-sky conditions.
- Wind cube lidar is optimizing its scan strategy. 
- No coordination with HALO on 18.08; first coordination planned for 20.08 or 21.08 

## Plans

- 18.08, 18:45 LT: Depart Pirata buoy 
- 18.08, 18:45 LT - 20.08, 12:00 LT: Steam towards 9.5 N, 26.714 W. Every 6 hours, perform a CTD, SEA-POL circle, and microstructure measurement.
- 20.08, 12:00 LT: Arrive at 9.5 N, 26.714 W (center of center circle of planned HALO flight for Tuesday 20.08)
- 20.08, 14:45 LT: Meet EarthCare overpass 
- 20.08, 15:00 LT - 21.08: Steam south along 26.7W towards Southern edge of ITCZ, meet HALO in their southern circle on 21.08 (if they fly)
- 22.08, 14:45 LT: Aim to meet EarthCare overpass on Southern edge of ITCZ
