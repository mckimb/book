## Summary

RV-METEOR remains at port in Mindelo, Cape Verde. The missing containers have arrived and are being loaded onto the ship. Lidar calibration is in process, and some scientists assisted the ship's crew in carrying provisions onto the ship. Sadly the drones did not arrive, so the drone team will not be sailing with Meteor. Since the port linemen do not work from 6 PM to 6 AM, departure is scheduled for 6 AM local time tomorrow (16 August).
